Based off of the work of [ronaldstoner](https://github.com/ronaldstoner) in the [AppleJuice repository](https://github.com/ECTO-1A/AppleJuice/blob/e6a61f6a199075f5bb5b1a00768e317571d25bb9/ESP32-Arduino/applejuice.ino).

Also thanks to [simondankelmann](https://github.com/simondankelmann) for their discoveries in new advertising messages to pop-up new notifications in iOS devices [source](https://github.com/simondankelmann/Bluetooth-LE-Spam/blob/main/app/src/main/java/de/simon/dankelmann/bluetoothlespam/AdvertisementSetGenerators/ContinuityActionModalAdvertisementSetGenerator.kt)

With the randomization optimizations it can render an iPhone almost useless with a single ESP32 (a new notification as soon as you close the old one).

Confirmed on:
* iPhone 15 (running iOS 17.1.2)
* iPhone 14 Pro Max (running iOS 17.2 b3) (See #19)
* iPhone 14 Pro (running iOS 16.6.1)
* iPhone 13 Pro (running iOS 17.4 (21E5184k))
* iPhone 11 (running iOS 16.6.1)
* iPhone X (running iOS 14.8 (18H17)) - only "AppleTV Keyboard", "TV Color Balance", "AppleTV Setup", "AppleTV Homekit Setup", "AppleTV New User".
* iPad Pro 11 (running iPadOS 17.3 (21D50))

Not working on:
* iPhone 4S (running iOS 10.3 (14E277))

Other observations:
* Doesn't seem to spawn notifications if Keyboard is open / Camera is open

### Security Vulnerability?

Since all we're doing is sending BLE advertisments from a "dumb" device, I argue there is no epxloit intent, just annoying.

[I've asked over a year ago on the Apple forums](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255127943), if it's possible to disable the feature where iDevices are eagerly awaiting advertisments and popping up notifications, but to no reply. Clearly Tim Apple^ thinks that he know how you should use your device better than you - in fact even if you disable Bluetooth from the quick settings or whatever its called, these will still keep coming - you need to go into settings and turn of Bluetooth completely. Which means you can't use your Airpods or whatever wireless audio device you purchased when they removed the 3.5mm jack.

*^ obviously I don't actually think Tim Cook is directly behind this, but rather Apple's smug nature of thinking they know what's best, and you're wrong if you don't think that's good design.*

## Notable Differences

This implementation makes the following changes:

* Random source MAC address (including `BLE_ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM`)
* Randomly pick BLE Advertisement Type ([this may lead to more success](https://github.com/ECTO-1A/AppleJuice/pull/25))
* Randomly pick one of the possible devices
* Sets the ESP32 BLE Power to the maximum (9dBm) to increase range

And it makes these random choices every time it runs (default re-advertise every second).

Given the 29 devices and the 3 advertisement types, there are a total of 87 unique possible advertisements (ignoring the random source MAC) possible, of which one is broadcast every second.

## Usage

Clone the repo, and easiest would be to use VS Code w/ PlatformIO to upload it to your ESP32.

This project has been tested on an [ESP32-C3 from AirM2M](https://wiki.luatos.com/chips/esp32c3/board.html).

### Via Arduino-CLI

#### Windows

If you've setup the Arduino CLI, e.g. via https://wellys.com/posts/esp32_cli/ , then you can `cd` into the `src` folder, and run the following:

```
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32c6 EvilAppleJuice-ESP32-INO -v
arduino-cli upload -p COM4 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32c6 EvilAppleJuice-ESP32-INO -v
arduino-cli monitor -c baudrate=115200 -p COM4
```

Replace `COM4` with the port the ESP32 is on, and `esp32c6` with the appropriate board.

### Spamming a specific device

Some basic instructions are here: https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/EvilAppleJuice-ESP32/issues/42#issuecomment-2294610072 , but if you're not a script kiddie you can probably figure it out.
